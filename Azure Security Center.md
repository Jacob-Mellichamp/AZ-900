### Azure Security Center

A monitoring service that provides visibility of your security posture across all your services, both on Azure and on-premises. The term security posture refers to cybersecurity policies and controls, as well as how well you can predict, prevent, and respond to security threats. 


Security Center can:

-   **Monitor** security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads.
-   Automatically apply required security settings to new resources as they come online.
-   **Provide security recommendations** that are based on your current configurations, resources, and networks.
-   Continuously monitor your resources and perform automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before those vulnerabilities can be exploited.
-   Use machine learning to detect and block malware from being installed on your virtual machines (VMs) and other resources. You can also use _adaptive application controls_ to define rules that list allowed applications to ensure that only applications you allow can run.
-   **Detect and analyze** potential inbound attacks and investigate threats and any post-breach activity that might have occurred.
-   Provide **just-in-time access control for network ports**. Doing so reduces your attack surface by ensuring that the network only allows traffic that you require at the time that you need it to.

### What's Secure Score.

A secure score is a measurement of an organization's security posture. Seure score is based on security controls, or groups of related security recommendations. Your score is based on the percentage of secuirty controls that you satisfy.

Secure score helps you:

-   Report on the current state of your organization's security posture.
-   Improve your security posture by providing discoverability, visibility, guidance, and control.
-   Compare with benchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs).
